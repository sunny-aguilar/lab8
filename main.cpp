** Description:     This program implements various searching and
**                  sorting algorithms. Text files are used
**                  to input data into arrays. A simple search
**                  algorithm is implemented to search for a value.
**                  Second, a sorting algorithm is implemented that
**                  is used to sort the values in the text files and
**                  output the results to an output file. Lastly, a
**                  binary search algorithm is implemented to search
**                  for a target value in the sorted data files from
**                  the sorting algorithm.
